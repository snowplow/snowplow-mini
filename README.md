# Snowplow Mini

[![Discourse posts][discourse-image]][discourse]
[![Build Status][build-image]][build-wf]
[![Release][release-image]][releases]
[![License][license-image]][license]

An easily-deployable, single instance version of Snowplow that serves three use cases:

1. Gives a Snowplow consumer (e.g. an analyst / data team / marketing team) a way to quickly understand what Snowplow "does" i.e. what you put in at one end and take out of the other
2. Gives developers new to Snowplow an easy way to start with Snowplow and understand how the different pieces fit together
3. Gives people running Snowplow a quick way to debug tracker updates (because they can)

## Features

* [x] Data is tracked and processed in real time
* [x] Added Iglu Server to allow for custom schemas to be uploaded
* [x] Data is validated during processing
  * This is done using both our standard Iglu schemas and any custom ones that you have loaded into the Iglu Server
* [x] Data is loaded into Opensearch
  * Can be queried directly or through a Opensearch dashboard
  * Good and bad events are in distinct indexes
* [x] Create UI to indicate what is happening with each of the different subsystems (collector, enrich etc.), so as to provide developers a very indepth way of understanding how the different Snowplow subsystems work with one another

*Note*: Starting with 0.15.0, Elasticsearch is replaced with Opensearch, and Kibana is replaced with Opensearch Dashboard. However, you may still encounter `elasticsearch` and `kibana` terms in the project.

## Documentation

Cloud setup guides for AWS and GCP, in addition to a usage guide, are available at [our docs website][mini-docs].

## Local Quick Start

To run `snowplow-mini` on your local machine you will need to install the following pre-requisites:

* [Vagrant][vagrant]
* [VirtualBox][virtualbox]

Then you should be able stand up a `snowplow-mini` locally by then running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-mini.git
  Cloning into 'snowplow-mini'...
$ cd snowplow-mini
$ vagrant up
  Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
```

This will take a little time to complete, so grab yourself a ☕️ and come back in a few minutes. See the troubleshooting section below if you encounter any errors.

Once complete, a Snowplow Collector will be running on `http://localhost:8080` and the Snowplow Mini UI will be on [http://localhost:2000/home](http://localhost:2000/home).

To log in to the Snowplow Mini UI for the first time, follow the `First time usage` section within the [documentation][mini-docs] for the version of Snowplow Mini you have just created.

Once you are finished with Snowplow Mini locally, it is wise to stop the virtual machine:

```bash
$ vagrant halt
  ==> default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
```

If you wish to tidy up all the resources, including deleting the virtual machine:

```bash
$ vagrant destroy
  default: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'default' VM? [y/N] y
  ==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...
```

## Vagrant Troubleshooting

Some advice on how to handle certain errors if you're trying to build this locally with Vagrant.

### `The box 'ubuntu/bionic64' could not be found or could not be accessed in the remote catalog.`

Your Vagrant version is probably outdated. Use Vagrant 2.0.0+.

### `npm install` results in `enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/package.json'`

This is caused by trying to use NFS. Comment the relevant lines in `Vagrantfile`.

Most likely this will happen on `TASK [sp_mini_5_build_ui : Install npm packages based on package.json.]` but see also: [https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com/t/snowplow-mini-local-vagrant/2930](https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com/t/snowplow-mini-local-vagrant/2930).

## Topology

Snowplow Mini runs several distinct applications on the same box which are all linked by NSQ topics.  In a production deployment each instance could be an Autoscaling Group and each NSQ topic would be a distinct Kinesis Stream.

* Stream Collector:
  * Starts server listening on `http://< sp mini public ip>/` which events can be sent to.
  * Sends "good" events to the `RawEvents` NSQ topic
  * Sends "bad" events to the `BadEvents` NSQ topic
* Stream Enrich:
  * Reads events in from the `RawEvents` NSQ topic
  * Sends events which passed the enrichment process to the `EnrichedEvents` NSQ topic
  * Sends events which failed the enrichment process to the `BadEvents` NSQ topic
* Elasticsearch Sink Good:
  * Reads events from the `EnrichedEvents` NSQ topic
  * Sends those events to the `good` Elasticsearch index
  * On failure to insert, writes errors to `BadElasticsearchEvents` NSQ topic
* Elasticsearch Sink Bad:
  * Reads events from the `BadEvents` NSQ topic
  * Sends those events to the `bad` Elasticsearch index
  * On failure to insert, writes errors to `BadElasticsearchEvents` NSQ topic

These events can then be viewed in Kibana at `http://< sp mini public ip>/kibana`.
